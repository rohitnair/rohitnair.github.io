<p>After Day 1 of Match-day 6 of the Uefa Champions league,14 of the 16 teams for the next round have been decided. Madrid "could" have gone out, Liverpool "could" and probably should have gone out, the mighty Rosenborg, for a change, "could" have qualified for the knockout stages. But in the end, none of it happened. All the biggies of European football have qualified for the next stage.Of the 12 teams from the major leagues,ie,La Liga,EPL and Serie A,10 have qualified,the other two being Valencia, who are having an awful season, and Lazio who don't belong to this stage anyways. 7 of the 8 groups have been topped by teams from the above mentioned 10. As far as European football is concerned, experience at the big stage almost always shows.</p>
<p>The draw for the knockout stage happens on December 21. Madrid have qualified as group leaders and thus avoid most of their major rivals. I just hope, come Feb 19th, the team wouldn't be making a trip to England.A trip to England's neighbour Scotland would be perfect though.</p>

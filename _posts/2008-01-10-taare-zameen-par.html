<p>Finally saw it last weekend. Got free tickets and the seats were at the last row and in the centre. Perfect place to watch the perfect movie from. The word "perfect" is something you would associate a lot with Aamir Khan and his work, and this movie is no different. Some parts of it are more like a documentary but it still is miles better than the usual shit Bollywood throws at us. The acting and the casting, superb! The music is quite unconventional(good job by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) and Prasoon Joshi's lyrics as usual are quite simple and interesting. It will no doubt transport you to your school days. The script might not be great(as in its predictable), the movie might drag in the middle but in the end its just a simple and extremely honest effort. Great job for a debutant director and Aamir Khan just reinforces the fact that hes the best Bollywood has. Must watch movie!</p>

<p>Feels good to be back home after a long time. There seems to be a rock concert going on at Durbar Hall Ground,around 500 metres away from my house. I can listen to them playing "The Roadhouse Blues" from my room. Apparently its a concert for charity. Times surely are changing. Although I doubt if anyone is watching these guys perform.</p>

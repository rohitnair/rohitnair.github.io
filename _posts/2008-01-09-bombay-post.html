<p>Dining out on the first weekend is a nice way to start the new year. Great way in fact, especially when it happens in one of Bangalore's top restaurants. Deciding on Bombay Post wasn't tough, it was close enough and most of us hadn't been there before. Its right next to the Airport Road - 100 Feet Road fly over and on the same building as TGIF, Indi Joe and Corner House. And yes, its another BJN group restaurant(one of many) . Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait for a table even though it was Saturday night.Â  The place and the cuisine,as the name suggests is inspired by Bombay and Bollywood in the 60s and 70s. Our table was overlooked by the villains of that generation, larger than life black and white potraits of Danny Denzongpa, Pran and Prem Chopra. Loud music, old fashioned ceiling fans, the feel of the place was quite authentic.</p>
<p>Now to the food.The menu looks quite similar to the other BJN restaurants serving Indian food but has an inclination towards sea food. We started off with some lamb shorba(trust me to forget those weird names) and Tandoori Pomfret, and tomato shorba and paneer rolls for the vegetarians.There was also a good selection of mocktails and coolers, and we ordered a fruit punch (called Churchgate something) and a mint cooler(it was a combination of mint,lime and Sprite if I'm not mistaken,it was great) The shorba was probably the low point of the meal, it was decent but nothing great. The starters on the other hand were heavenly, the Pomfrets were spicy,well marinated and grilled to perfection. The paneer rolls were pretty good as well. For the main course, we again decided to try some seafood and ordered Hariyali Jhinga(prawns). We also ordered some nans,kulchas and Makhani Murgh Post Special (which the waiter nonchalantly degraded to Butter chicken) The vegetarians went for some mixed vegetable curry(which i sadly didn't try out) and yellow dal. The food was great and we had no complains whatsoever to lick those plates clean. The nans, as with all BJN restaurants were more roti like, but as long as its not hard like rotis, its fine. We finished off with some Shehenshahi Pulao which was as good as any other dish. The place is relatively expensive though, and the total bill came to around Rs 500+ per head. We decided to have dessert from nearby corner house although we did try out the caramel custard which was pretty decent. The service is great too and our orders hardly took any time. One of my best dining experiences in Bangalore yet.</p>

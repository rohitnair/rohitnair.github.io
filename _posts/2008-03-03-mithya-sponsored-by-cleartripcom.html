<p>Man,you just gotta love online ticket booking! Especially when the site gives you 10 free movie tickets apart from the obvious benefits. Cleartrip.com has this offer of giving 10 movie tickets redeemable at bookmyshow.com when you book tickets on Air Deccan for two. Sweet! Well,they last only for a month and you can redeem only two on a given day,so I decided to redeem them the next day itself and booked tickets for Mithya. bookmyshow.com is pretty neat, you can even chose your seats and I went for the ones with the best view,top row center.</p>
<p>Now to the movie, which is getting some nice reviews from the critics and rightly so. Its obviously not the typical Bollywood fare, but a quality film with a decent story, great acting and of course Rajat Kapoor as the director. Ranvir Shorey has really grabbed this rare opportunity as a lead in a movie with both hands and done a great job. He plays the role of a struggling actor who happens to be the look-alike of a gangster. The support cast of Naseeruddin Shah,Vinay Pathak and co ain't too bad either. The movie starts off with a lot of humour but slowly the twists and turns start coming and the story takes over. The film probably wouldn't do well at the box office and probably wouldn't appeal to the masses either as was evident from the theater, the gold class was full while the silver class was more than half empty. I'd definitely recommend it though, its a good quality Hindi flick thats a welcome change.</p>

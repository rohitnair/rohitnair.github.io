<p>If you are eager to lay your hands on the new beta version of Firefox 3 but don't want it to erase your existing installation of Firefox (which has all those extensions and saved passwords and bookmarks that you painstakingly installed and saved up),well worry not! The guys at PortableApps have come up with a portable edition that installs itself without affecting the existing one. You can get the latest beta <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable/test">here.</a> As expected,a lot of extensions and themes are not yet supported. And for those who can't live without Firebug, there's a beta version of it that works with Firefox 3 as well. Firefox 3 by the way, looks neater and does have an evident performance improvement. One new feature that you notice straight away is the auto completion when you type in a URL which searches even from your bookmarks. Some sites do crash the browser though, Yahoo! Mail being one of them. Hopefully all the bugs will be ironed out once the stable version is released.</p>
<p>Edit: Beta 5 is out. Yahoo! Mail doesn't seem to crash the browser anymore.</p>

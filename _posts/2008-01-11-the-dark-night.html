<p>Damn those sucky sites that have no hesitation in drawing money from our credit cards but never wonder what they did with it! Thanks to one such site, we didn't have power at our house since yesterday. No lights, no computer, no ironing, no geyser(in winter).....well you get the idea.Â  Plus our cable guy cut our line last week(not that it would help when there's no power).So basically,there's been no TV since last week and no power since yesterday. What a life.<br />
And since when did government agencies like the electricity board get so efficient? The due date for last month's bill was 25th of December and its just been 15 days! The guy in charge obviously has way too much free time on his hands to be going around removing fuses from houses of poor people like us.</p>

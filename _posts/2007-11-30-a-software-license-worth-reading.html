<p>Here's a license with a difference, with an objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of all things! WordWeb ( a common English dictionary program) allows you to use the program free of charge beyond the 30 day trial period ONLY if</p>
<ul>
<li>You take at most 4 flights (2 return flights) in any 12 month period</li>
<li>AND you do not own or regularly drive an SUV (sports utility vehicle).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read the full license <a href="http://wordweb.info/free/licence.html">here</a> , at the risk of feeling guilty of software theft of course.</p>
<p>Searched for more such interesting licenses. Here are a few</p>
<ol>
<li>The relatively more famous <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">WTFPL</a> : As the name suggests it allows you to do WTF you want to.</li>
<li>Something that calls itselfÂ  <a href="http://homepage.usask.ca/~ijm451/prox/help/help/License.html">"Shoneware"</a> : This radical new concept in software distribution is in the support of the Shonen Knife, world famous, female power-trio of musicians from Osaka, Japan.</li>
<li><a href="http://spazioinwind.libero.it/unforgiven/frameset.htm">Sisterware</a> : You can use the program free of cost as long as you send the author information about your sister. And hes actually got 255 messages. You can read them <a href="http://spazioinwind.libero.it/unforgiven/sisterware.htm">here</a>. Good to know honest people still exist in this world.</li>
</ol>

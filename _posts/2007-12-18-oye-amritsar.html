<p>Good food is probably the biggest love of my life.I thought I'd dedicate some posts to that love and review some of the restaurants I've been to.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my brother in law's birthday and we were searching for a place for the birthday treat. It had to be a place we hadn't been to and had to be moderately expensive as we had to meet a budget of at least Rs.2000(yes,not at most but at least). After some searching and filtering, we decided to go to this place called Oye Amritsar on Church Street. Its a rooftop dhaba and is relatively easy to spot. Its on the same building as Saigon and Ruby Tuesday. The decor as expected was true dhaba style with brightly painted wooden windows, milk cans etc.  The tables and chairs were simple and comfortable and the place was covered with funny  one-liners and name boards. And they serve in steel tumblers and steel plates,for the added effect(and an easy way to save costs i presume). Each table had mint chutney and the typical set of chopped onions, green chillies and pickles as well.</p>

<p>The menu was simple yet varied enough, not too many items so as to confuse you,and not too few either. Most dishes had fancy names (or rather authentic Punjabi names?) with a description to help you choose. We started off with Paneer Pakoras, a chicken (which they refer to as Kukkad) shorba and a chicken  kabab. (Can't really recall the names of the dishes we ordered) My sis ordered a lassi which came in a huge tumbler. The food was served surprisingly fast. The shorba was yummy and didnt taste like anything I've tasted before. It had loads of butter and a strong garlic flavour. I loved it! The kababs were really good as well, and the chicken cooked to perfection. For the main course, we ordered the staple Makki di roti and Sarson da Saag, along with Chole, chicken curry(whose description mentioned something about a secret home made recipe) and some kulchas,rotis and parathas. The food again was served quickly and disappeared equally fast. The quantity of the curries was decent(don't let the size of the vessels fool you) The rotis were a bit too hard and burnt for my liking but all the curries were excellent. The Chole was awesome and the chicken had a different yet good flavour. After stuffing ourselves, i had to order some dessert. We ordered Kulfi with Falooda and a plate of Jalebis. The kulfi was pretty good and the Jalebis hot,crisp and fresh and served with malai.</p>
<p>The bill finally came to around 1950(leaving us disappointed because we missed the magic figure by 50 odd rupees), and that comes to about 400 per head. I'd definitely recommend it to others and wouldn't mind visiting the place again myself.</p>

<p>What a week it's been, probably one of my best after coming to Bangalore. To summarize the events,</p>
<p>sprint deadlines, work late, legacy systems, ecstasy(cafe), addiction(cafe),Â  barton fink(movie), meetings, curse IE, bamboo shoots(restaurant), bowling @ amoeba, meet family, home food, football, dostana(movie), taken(movie), skandagiri, night trek, get drenched in rain.</p>
<p>I doubt if I'll be able to move a muscle tomorrow. Time for some much needed rest.</p>

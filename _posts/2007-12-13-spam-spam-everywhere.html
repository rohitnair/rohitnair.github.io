<p>A recent study shows that close to 95% of all mail sent over the internet was spam! Phew,thats just an awfully large percentage. But, I'm not really surprised either. One of my projects was a spam filter and I know how easy it is to send spam. All you need is a mail server setup in your system(most linux distros come with postfix pre-installed) There are ones available for Windows as well, I used one called Postcast server.<br />
Configuring them hardly takes minutes and you can send a mail that claims its coming from foo@bar.com or any ID for that matter,even your own! Most e-mail providers are doing their best to stop spam but spammers find ways to pass even the strictest spam filters. I remember the Gmail server blocking my IP because a lot of spam was originating from it. You can easily overcome this, thanks to dynamic IP addressing.<br />
Anyways,lets hope spam filters get better and we have a spam-less internet.</p>

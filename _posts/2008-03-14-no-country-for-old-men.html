<p>I just had to watch this movie, considering it had won 3 Oscars, but more because it was made by the Coen brothers. I loved Fargo and and liked the weird comedy,The Big Lebowski (although I don't think it's that great a movie). Well, this one's a much more serious movie although it still has doses of the trademark Coen brothers' twisted and dark humor. And it certainly isn't one for the masses, its what many people here call an "award" movie. First of all its slow and has very few dialogues, and the ending is definitely not something a lot of people will like. Its a movie that's open to interpretation and not one where the directors force a message on the viewers. The movie is set in Texas, close to the Mexican border and the accent can get a bit tough to follow. I had to rewind and listen to some of the dialogues again quite a few times. Among the actors,Javier Bardem probably deserves a mention for the character he plays, he's perfect as the cold, ruthless killer,easily one of the more memorable villains of recent times. In the end,its a dark movie, there's no happy ending, no ray of light. But if you are a fan of the Coen brothers, there's nothing that should stop you from watching this. Here's one of the funnier lines of the movie that's often shown in the trailers as well.This is what one of the main characters says to his wife before leaving for the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Llewelyn Moss</strong>: If I don't come back, tell mother I love her.<br />
<strong>Carla Jean Moss</strong>: Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.<br />
<strong>Llewelyn Moss</strong>: Well then I'll tell her myself.</p>
<p>I think i'll be watching the movie again,with subtitles ON.</p>

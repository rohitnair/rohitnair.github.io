<p>Got my 2nd generation 80GB Zune last weekend, thanks a ton to Sony for getting it from the US. A few people have been asking me, why the Zune? Why not the iPod? Which company makes Zunes?</p>
<p>Most people here haven't heard about the Zune mainly because its sold only in the US and since recently in Canada, unlike the iPod which is more of a global product. And the 2nd generation was released in October of 2007, so its quite a new product. Unlike the first generation, which became the butt of all mp3 player jokes, this one has been received well by most critics, some even stating it to be better than the iPod.</p>
<p>The main features I was looking for were<br />
- Minimum 80GB<br />
- Would be used to play videos as well<br />
- Radio would be a plus,though not a necessity<br />
- Should handle a decent number of file types<br />
- Value for money</p>
<p>Had to do some research to narrow down on my selection. Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_portable_media_players">comparison chart</a> that can be a great starting point. In the end, some of the options I had were the iPod( Touch and Classic), Zune, Archos 605 and a couple of others like the Cowon A3. The iPod touch has only 16GB and is way expensive, although it is a much more capable device. Between the Zune and the iPod, the Zune costs almost the same, has an FM tuner and has a 3.2" screen compared to a 2.5" for the iPod. The Archos 605 seems to be the favourite for many reviewers, but it costs 100$ more, is quite bulky and you need to pay extra for each plugin, even the web browser. But again, its almost in a different class of device, more closer to the iPod Touch. Plus I had read a lot of negative feedback about the Archos player especially regarding their customer care. Surely, an MS or Apple product would be more reliable and will have better support than say an Archos or a Cowon device. In the end, the cost plus the big screen made me select the Zune.</p>

<p>First impressions of the Zune have been impressive, it really looks a lot cooler than an iPod. The headphones bundled with it are premium headphones(worth 50$ if you buy them separately) and they are awesome. The ones that come with the iPod cannot be even compared with these. The UI is intuitive and feels great thanks to the touch controls. The software is quite easy to use as well, and is supposed to be much improved compared to its predecessor. It seems to be quite basic though,you can't change the meta tags associated with songs in it, which you can using iTunes. Its built to be used with the Zune unlike iTunes which is more than capable as a stand alone mp3 player.Â  A major drawback of the Zune(and the iPod) is that it doesn't play AVI files. And yes, the vast majority of videos happen to be in that format. You need to convert it to wmv to play it on the Zune. MS has a free utility called the Windows Media Encoder which can do this conversion. It takes close to 40 minutes to convert a 350MB file which is the typical size of say a Lost or Prison Break episode and probably around 1 hour to convert a 700MB movie. Ill get to know more of the Zune's shortcomings as I use it more, hopefully there aren't many. As of now, I have absolutely no complaints. Zune FTW!</p>

<p>Saturday night<br />
In its flight<br />
A bat<br />
On me it sat<br />
DRAT!</p>
<p>The only part of poetry that appeals to me, as you can guess by now, are the rhyming words! Anyways, that was about my first close encounter with a bat. Some say it might be an omen, I'm Batman maybe. Or more likely a vampire? Hmmm.....</p>

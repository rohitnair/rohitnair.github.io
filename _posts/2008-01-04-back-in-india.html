<p>Got back from Singapore this week and I must say last week was one of the best weeks in a long time! The trip was awesome, couldn't go to Malaysia as we had planned before but that meant we could explore Singapore in full detail. Walked a lot, discovered a lot more, ate tons of beef and pork in the form of junk food(I was happy to stay far away from the local cuisines), saw quite a few movies,some on a 37" LCD screen with a Bose sound system and even a couple in-flight.And to top it off,Madrid won the Clasico!</p>
<p>Happy New Year to All!</p>

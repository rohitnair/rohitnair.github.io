<p>It's been a long time since i posted here, and a longer time since i posted a restaurant review. I've been caught up with work lately, and hence the lack of time. I have been to quite a few restaurants in the past few weeks though and i thought I'll just summarize my views here. Ratings in brackets next to the restaurant name</p>
<p><strong>Giancarlo's Place</strong> (3.5/5)<br />
Went here with my team as it's just across our office. The place looks very upscale and has nice ambience. As for the food, it was good at best.The garlic bread they served us was not too good, the crust was just too hard. I had lasagna for my main course and it was decent and very filling. The selection of desserts is quite limited and falls well short compared to the choice at Sunny's next door. Service was ordinary, and i remember we had to wait at least 15 minutes for the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Toscanos</strong> (4/5)<br />
One of the new joints that have opened up in the UB City food court. They bread they serve at the start is awesome. Our starter(smoked salmon) was quite disappointing, the portion especially small. The main course(i had some Toscano's special chicken) though was heavenly. Didn't have the appetite that day to try out their desserts but i've heard they are pretty good as well. The food is served aesthetically and you might find it hard to dig your fork in!</p>

<p><strong>Rajdhani </strong>(4.5/5)<br />
This one's right next to Toscano's and is probably the most popular joint at UB City. They serve only North Indian Thalis and that in Jain style (which means no onions, no garlic etc) If you are planning to have lunch there on a weekend, be prepared to wait at least 1 hour! But the wait is well worth it, the variety and the quality of food is top notch. Veggies who love North Indian food would swear by this place for sure. And at 150Rs, it's quite a steal.</p>
<p><strong>Brindavan </strong>(4/5)<br />
This is one of those old quaint places that seem to be stuck in time. One of the cheapest options on MG Road for sure. The food is good and their coffee excellent, easily one of the best in Bangalore. The place i think is run by Tamilians and for a change you get the authentic Sambar there, not the local version.</p>
<p><strong>Hyd Mahal </strong>(4/5)<br />
Hyd Mahal is one of those many restaurants on Church street. And there's only one thing i had to try there and that's their Biryani. And it sure didn't disappoint! The biryani is authentic Hyderabad style, but not as spicy as the one they serve in Hyderbadi Biryani, it's a bit richer with raisins and nuts which I absolutely love in Biryanis. Good service as well, surely worth a visit.</p>
<p><strong>Raaga</strong> (3/5)<br />
Apparently, this place is one of older restaurants in Indira Nagar. But the place sure has lost its charm over the years. They have crammed in as many tables as they can, and the stairs are so steep and narrow, they can make anyone dizzy. All this leads to quite a chaotic ambience in the restaurant. They serve typical North Indian fare and the menu has good variety. The food was quite ordinary, with it's high and low points, the chicken shorba especially was terrible. Would not recommend.</p>
<p>That's it for this post. Happy dining to all!</p>

<p>I'm talking about the much awaited release of GTA IV of course.The game is finally out and the critics are already raving about it. Just to give you an idea,check out the ratings given by some of the mainstream game reviewers<br />
- IGN : 10/10 overall plus 10/10 in each of the categories,the first time they've given a perfect score since '99!<br />
- Gamespot.com : 10/10, first game since 2001 to get that rating<br />
- Official Xbox 360 Magazine : 10/10<br />
- Official PS3 Magazine : 10/10<br />
- Xbox World 360 - 98%,their highest rating for a game yet<br />
The list goes on and on,and obviously the hype surrounding the game was worth it. This is what NY times had to say about the game "violent, intelligent, profane, endearing, obnoxious, sly, richly textured and thoroughly compelling work of cultural satire disguised as fun". I think that just sums up the GTA series as a whole,and GTA IV seems to have touched perfection. I just CANNOT wait to get my hands on it. Sadly, there is no PC version and there may never be one(i even found an online petition asking them to launch it soon,lol). The only way I could play it would be on the PS3 in office! Need to convince the necessary people to get a copy somehow!!</p>
<p>Edit : My wish has come true! Thanks a ton to Ankit for getting it from US. PS3, a huge Plasma TV with HDMI cable and GTA IV, what more could you ask for!</p>

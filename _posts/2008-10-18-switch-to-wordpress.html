<p>Now that I have a domain name of my own, thought I'll move my blog to it and use good ol' simple wordpress to maintain it. Setting it up took mere minutes and thanks to <a title="ljArchive" href="http://fawx.com/software/ljarchive/" target="_blank">ljarchive</a>, I could export all my livejournal posts in a jiffy. Also, trying out a plugin that will apparently cross post to livejournal.</p>

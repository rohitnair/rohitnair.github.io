<p>This post is long overdue.Anyways,here goes.</p>
<p>I had won a Taj gift voucher thanks to a Deutsche Bank slogan contest. And when the time came to decide a place for Amma's birthday treat, it was an obvious choice. Selecting a restaurant from the three Taj Hotels in the city was not that obvious though, and we finally decided to try out Mynt at the Taj West End. The place servers Italian, Mediterranean, Lebanese and Indian cuisines. A good thing was that they had this brunch buffet on Sundays so we didn't exactly have to go through the entire menu and order the cheapest/cheaper items. We had booked a table in advance, and I think that was a good idea considering the place was close to full. Although its called the Sunday Brunch, its open till the afternoon and you can easily go there for your lunch (as we did). Frankly, doing a review on the food is tough. But in one word,it would be "Variety"! The number of items on the buffet is just mind boggling,you could make a full meal out of just the starters,or the desserts or one of the specialized cuisine counters.</p>
<p>Started off with a chicken soup,which was pretty good. The starters section literally had an endless selection, Indian chats, Salads, kababs, it had it all. It was tough to chose from, in the end I went with some safe bets like the Hawaiian salad and tried out a few never-heard-of-it-before stuff as well. There's a section where you can make your own salad as well, they keep ingredients that you can mix and match to your tastes. We didn't even venture that side, not worth wasting time and precious appetite for.<br />

<p>The main course section is basically divided into three sections, each for a certain cuisine. Each section has chefs who can make certain dishes on order. I found them more useful to explain what some of the dishes were! First was the Italian section, you could ask the chef to make you pasta or pizza. You can choose the toppings you want, the type of pasta, the sauces you want to be added etc. The pizza was as good as it can get at least in India, and the pasta was really good as well. There were quite a few other dishes here,  Buttered vegetables with Baby Potatoes, Fish in rock salt, some ham and so on. Its almost impossible to recall each and every dish from the spread. The next section was for Lebanese food. The chef could make some Pita bread to go with the curries or you could have them with Zafrani Pulao. You could also order for Shawarmas although we didn't try them out. The curries were spicy and similar to Indian dishes, there was a potato dish that was floating around in ghee, chicken curry with saffron seasoning and a tenderloin curry(yes,I tried out tenderloin for the first time in my life) The next section was Indian food, and as expected it had a familiar look to it. Appams with stew, biriyanis, prawns in mango flavoured gravy, Murgh Awadhi etc. Again, no complains about the food, they were pretty much as good as it can get.</p>
<p>Our lunch was far from over though, there was the expansive dessert section left to be conquered! Trust me, its heaven for any dessert freak. Ice creams, pastries, pies, tarts, dough-nuts, muffins, souffles, puddings and finally even a decent selection of Indian sweets. I pretty much tried everything that I could and stuffed myself. Not an inch was spared, I could hardly breathe! And we had even ordered a cake for Amma. We just had a bite of that and asked the rest to be packed. Finally,it was time for the not so nice part, the bill! Thanks to the bill, we were rudely awakened from our gastronomical nirvana. Its not as if we were expecting a cheap meal, but this just exceeded all those expectations. By a good country mile. The voucher i had won didn't even cover the cost of one person's meal! It was no surprise that the crowd mainly consisted of foreigners and what appeared to be THE elite of Bangalore society. It was easily the costliest meal I have ever had, and probably ever will in India.  Its definitely an experience but is it worth the money? As the engadget.com folks would put it, it depends on your annual salary.</p>
